# 01 — How the Game Works

Before writing any code, understand what you're building.

---

## The Grid

The game is a **20×20 invisible grid**. Every object — snake, food, threats — is just a set of `{x, y}` coordinates.

```
snake = [
  { x: 10, y: 10 },   ← head
  { x:  9, y: 10 },
  { x:  8, y: 10 },   ← tail
]
```

## How the Snake Moves

Every tick (~140ms):
1. Calculate the new head position (one step in current direction)
2. **Add** it to the front of the array
3. **Remove** the tail from the end

When food is eaten — skip step 3. The snake grows by one.

## The Three Files

## Cyber Defender Snake's Extra Rules

| Item | What happens |
|---|---|
| 🟢 Data packet (food) | Snake grows, score +1 |
| 🔴 Threat node | Hit it → risk briefing shown, score -1000 |
| 🟩 Defense node | Collect it → lesson card shown, score +1000 |

Threats and defenses are **tethered** — they always spawn as a pair. Collect the defense before touching the threat.
